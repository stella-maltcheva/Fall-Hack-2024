Installation: To install our project, you open our GitHub and download all the files. 
Running the project: Run the fallhacks2024.html, it should open in a browser. 
How to play the game: The browser will show a panicked emoji. To move, use the <- and -> arrows. 
                      The emoji will start moving, this emoji is meant to represent a stressed student. 
                      The objective of the game is to catch as many of the falling objects as possible. 
                      The more you get, the higher of a score you will recieve. 
                      If you fail to catch an object, the game terminates and shows your score. 
                      You can start the game again by pressing the button "OK" button on the pop up that shows the score of your game.
